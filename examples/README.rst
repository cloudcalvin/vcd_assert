The basic examples are very simple examples

Usage
-----
All examples have a few scripts that runs them

clean.sh : Cleans the output generated by running the other scripts
run_cver.sh : Runs the example through cver (Requires cver to findable on the path)
run_iverilog.sh : Runs the example through iverilog (Requires iverilog to be findable on the path)
run_vcd_assert.sh : TODO

Basic examples
--------------

These examples are very simple, but cover different ways to specify the sdf
file. All the basic tests (except the jtl and splitter) have both one that has
no timing violations and one that has a timing violation.

DRO: Specified in verilog with direct instance name
AND: Specified on commandline with direct instance name (No Verilog files)
Splitter and JTL: No SDF timing checks
NDRO: Specified in verilog with "*" instance
XOR: Specified on the commandline with "*" instance

Bigger examples

TODO

Notes
------
The basic NDRO doesn't run in IVerilog due to a bug in IVerilog.
